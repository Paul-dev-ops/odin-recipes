    <p>December is here, and with the winter we also have
        this delicious potion of the gods
    </p><br>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 litre of milk</li>
        <li>1/2 litre of heavy cream</li>
        <li>180 gr of brown sugar</li>
        <li>5 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 tbsp of cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp NutMeg</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Cinnamon</li>
        <li>180 ml Rum</li>
    </ul>

    <br>

    <h3>1,2,3.....Alchemy!</h3>
    <ol> 
        <li>On a cooking pot, lets pour the milk following by the heavy cream
            in total, and 3/4 of the brown sugar... (we will use the rest later on)</li><br>
        <li>Once all previous items are mixed and added into the pot, lets cook it
        on medium heat until we reach 60c... be careful not to wait until the
        milk starts to boil.</li><br>
        <li>On a bowl lets have the egg yolks and rest of brown sugar mixed with
        a balloon whisk, Once the egg yolks start to look clarified and creamy 
        at that point we're gonna need to pour the warmed milk mix little by 
        little and keep stirring the egg yolks with the milk.</li><br>
        <li>then with everything mix at this point we're going to return to the
        stove and on lowest heat we will mix everything, without stopping
        for at least 20 straight minutes in order not to let the mix get lumpy.</li><br>
        <li>while we're slow heating the mix on the stove, we're gonna need
        to dissolve the cornstarch with 100 ml of waters and then add to the mix.</li><br>
        <li>Keep stirring!! we're almost done!</li><br>
        <li>this is the momment to add all the spices and keep stirring!</li><br>
        <li>once the mixed gets thickened, turn off the heat and put it
            on a ventilated space so it starts gets to room temperature.
        </li><br>
        <li>Once the mix is at room temperature, add the rum</li><br>
        <li>put all the ponche crema liquor on crystal bottles</li><br>
        <li>let the bottle of that delicious potion rest for at least 12 hours</li><br>
        <li>Served with some ice cubes, and enjoy!</li><br>
     </ol>
