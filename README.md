welcome to my italian venezuelan recipes website. named "Alchemy"

this is a place to enjoy, and have fun with the ones you love the most.
here you will find recipes, liquor, lots of coffee and venezuelan 
seasonal dishes.

the main idea of the website is to use quality products and provide 
extra tips on where to find good prices for those products.

it will be a responsive/styled website, with videos, pictures of the 
dishes and drinks. it will also include several pages such as "main 
page", "drinks", "Coffee" and "items"


happy cooking!

From the "Alchemy" team!
